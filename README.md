# FlightPricePrediction
Flight tickets prices are something hard to guess. The prices are changing everyday. We might often heard from the travelers that the flight ticket prices are unpredictable.So, here we use the Machine Learning to solve this problem by predicting the flight ticket price.

Data set gives different information about various airlines such as source,destination,duration,date of journey etc....

Here the objective is to predict the price of flight tickets and we use Regression analysis model to train and predict the data.

Linear Regression and RandomForestRegressor are used here to perform Machine Learning model and also perform some hyperparameter tuning on RendomForestRegressor.
